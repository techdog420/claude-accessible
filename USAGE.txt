CLAUDE CODE ACCESSIBLE SCRIPT - USAGE GUIDE
===========================================

Created for screen reader users to work with Claude Code without terminal crashes.

FILES CREATED:
--------------
- claude-accessible.bat (for Windows - USE THIS ONE)
- claude-accessible.sh (for Linux/Mac)
- USAGE.txt (this file)

WINDOWS USAGE:
--------------

1. Start a new conversation:
   claude-accessible.bat "Analyze the code in auth.py"

2. Continue the conversation:
   claude-accessible.bat --continue "Now check for security issues"

   Or use shorthand:
   claude-accessible.bat -c "What about the database queries?"

3. Start fresh (discards previous session):
   claude-accessible.bat --new "Help me with a different project"

   Or use shorthand:
   claude-accessible.bat -n "New task here"

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
- Automatically saves session IDs to continue conversations
- Auto-approves tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task)
- Saves all conversations to claude-history.txt for review
- No interactive prompts that crash screen readers
- All output is linear and screen reader friendly

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
--------------------
All your prompts and responses are saved to:
   claude-history.txt

You can review this file anytime with your text editor or screen reader.

SESSION MANAGEMENT:
------------------
The current session ID is stored in:
   .claude-session

To start completely fresh, either:
- Use the --new flag
- Delete the .claude-session file manually

EXAMPLES:
---------
# Start analyzing a project
claude-accessible.bat "List all Python files in this directory"

# Continue with follow-up questions
claude-accessible.bat -c "Read the main.py file"
claude-accessible.bat -c "Find any functions that handle user input"
claude-accessible.bat -c "Check those functions for SQL injection vulnerabilities"

# Start a new unrelated task
claude-accessible.bat -n "Help me write a script to process CSV files"

TIPS:
-----
- Keep prompts in quotes to handle spaces
- Use --continue (-c) to maintain context
- Check claude-history.txt to review past conversations
- The script auto-approves safe tools to avoid interactive prompts

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If you get errors about session resumption:
- Use --new to start fresh
- Or delete .claude-session file

If output seems truncated:
- Check claude-history.txt for full conversation
